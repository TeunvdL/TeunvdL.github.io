            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Six Months</p>
            <p><strong>Group:</strong> Autonomous and Complex Systems group, TU/e</p>
            <p><strong>Commissioned by:</strong> TNO</p>
            <p>
                This project aimed to develop an accurate traffic simulation model to assess the impact of autonomous vehicles on traffic safety and flow. Real-world traffic data was collected to generate realistic distributions of key metrics. These distributions formed the basis for calibrating an agent-based traffic simulation model.
