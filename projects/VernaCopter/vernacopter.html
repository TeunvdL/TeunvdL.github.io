            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>VernaCopter is an innovative drone control system that leverages natural language processing and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) for motion planning. The goal of this project is to allow users to control drones by simply describing tasks in natural language, which are then converted into executable motion plans using STL. This breakthrough approach aims to simplify drone operation, making it more accessible to non-experts while still maintaining precision and efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>At the heart of VernaCopter is a sophisticated motion planning system that combines natural language processing with signal temporal logic. The system takes input from users in the form of natural language descriptions, processes it using a pre-trained language model, and translates these instructions into executable motion plans. The motion plans are then executed by the droneâ€™s onboard control system, ensuring smooth and accurate flight paths.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <p>Throughout the development of VernaCopter, several challenges were encountered, such as accurately interpreting ambiguous natural language instructions and ensuring that the drone could execute plans in a stable and reliable manner. Solutions involved refining the NLP pipeline, incorporating error correction mechanisms, and ensuring that the motion planning system was robust to unforeseen situations.</p>
